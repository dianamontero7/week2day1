    <h1>In Jesus I Abide ‚úù</h1>
    <h3> By Bettina Van Vaerenbergh </h3>

    <div class="poem">

    <p>
        No matter what happens in my life,<br>
        Sorrow or joy, rain or shine,<br>
        Whatever befalls me, it's all right<br>
        Because in Jesus I abide.

        </p>
        
       <p>With His presence, He shelters me <br>
        From many dangers all too real. <br>
        Like a lamb, He carries me <br>
        Over steep hill and stormy sea.
        
        </p>

       <p>In the midst of pain and hurt,<br>
        When I feel confused and stirred,<br>
        To Jesus I can always turn<br>
        And find solace in His Word.

        </p>
        
       <p>His is the only voice I hear,<br>
        So familiar and so dear.<br>
        I know that I can trust in Him,<br>
        So to Him alone I cling.

        </p>
        
        <p>Jesus keeps me from going astray;<br>
        I'll always follow in His way.<br>
        Forever loved, secure and safe,<br>
        I stand in His amazing grace.
    
    </p>
